 I scraped data from the SteamDB website using Python,  I collected information about the top Steam games, including their names, current players, and peak players, and saved the results in a CSV file.  Then, I loaded the data back into Python, cleaned it, and used Matplotlib to create a bar chart showing the top games by the number of players.
